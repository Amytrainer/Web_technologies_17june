# Life in Weeks Coding Exercise
I was reading this article by Tim Urban-Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

In this challenge,you are going to create a function that tells us how many days,weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days,y weeks,and z months left.
Where x,y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
